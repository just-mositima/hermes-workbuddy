/**
 * Wiring the CLI route into the plugin, and normalizing its settings.
 *
 * THE ROUTE IS OPT-IN AND NON-BREAKING. It is `enabled: false` by default, and
 * its two host surfaces are mounted reactively by the caller (`ctx.inject`), not
 * sampled once at apply time. That combination is deliberate: this plugin is
 * installed by people whose only interest is the provider, and a new hard
 * dependency would either fail their mount or silently remove their models.
 *
 * THE MOUNT IS TWO INDEPENDENT SURFACES ON PURPOSE. `codebuddy_ask` and
 * `/codebuddy` come from two different host services that become available at
 * different moments (and can come and go). So the settings are normalized ONCE
 * into a `CliBridgeRuntime` — options plus the shared turn gate — and each
 * surface mounts and disposes on its own. That is why the mid-sized fact "the
 * tool and the command share one budget" survives a re-mount: the gate lives on
 * the runtime, not on either surface.
 *
 * WHY THE ROUTE EXISTS AT ALL, stated honestly. The provider route has to look
 * like a CodeBuddy client to get past the gateway's channel check, and that is an
 * arms race the upstream fights with zero-width-space perturbation (see
 * `perturbChannelFingerprints`). This route does not impersonate anything — but
 * it uses the SAME vault account, so it is a client-fingerprint win, NOT a way
 * around an account restriction (code 11140). The first draft's README claimed
 * otherwise; do not let that claim come back.
