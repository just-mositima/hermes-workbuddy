/**
 * `/codebuddy` — one CodeBuddy turn started from the composer.
 *
 * WHY A COMMAND AND NOT JUST THE TOOL. `codebuddy_ask` only runs when the model
 * decides to call it, which costs a DSH turn and a decision. A slash command is
 * the one host channel that executes against the receiving agent WITHOUT sending
 * the line to the model, so the WORK costs no DSH turns.
 *
 * THE ONE THING IT DOES SPEND BY DEFAULT. On success the result is handed back to
 * the session's model so the conversation knows what happened, and that wake-up
 * is a real DSH turn with real tokens. The first draft's description claimed the
 * command "does not consume DSH quota", which is false under the default
 * `injectResult: true`; the description now says so. With `injectResult: false`
 * the promise holds: nothing but the human sees the result.
 *
 * WHAT AN EMPTY LINE MEANS. `/codebuddy` alone is a review: the built-in brief
 * asks CodeBuddy to read the uncommitted changes and report problems. Anything
 * the human types is sent verbatim instead.
 *
