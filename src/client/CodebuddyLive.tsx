/**
 * The composer pill that says what the CodeBuddy CLI route is doing RIGHT NOW.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A bridged turn is a spawned agent: minutes of reading files
 * and running commands, then one answer. The Host tool contract has no progress
 * channel — `execute()` returns when it returns — so without this pill the user
 * watches a spinner with no way to tell "still working" from "hung". The pill is
 * fed by the plugin's own read-only route (`WORKBUDDY_CLI_LIVE_PATH`), which
 * serializes the host-side live board (see `../cli-bridge/live.ts`).
 *
 * WHY IT RENDERS NOTHING WHEN IDLE. This is the ambient dock under the composer,
 * a row the shell already fills with round/token pills. A permanent "no turn
 * running" line would be a claim about a feature most users never switch on
 * (`cliBridge.enabled` defaults to false), so the empty state is `null`: the row
 * is untouched until there is something true to say.
 *
 * WHY IT ONLY DESCRIBES THIS SESSION'S TURN. The board is host-wide: one route
 * answers for every session in the process, so an unfiltered pill would show the
 * turn another tab started — a line about a directory the user is not looking at,
 * sitting under the composer they are typing in. The seat is declared
 * `scope: 'session'` (`conversation.composer.dock`), so the framework hands the
 * registration its `sessionId`; the pill keeps the rows that belong to it.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE PROVIDER GATE THE CREDIT READOUT USES. `ComposerCredits` renders
 * only while the session's model is a WorkBuddy provider, because it reports that
 * provider's quota. This pill reports a spawned CLI process, and the CLI route is
 * deliberately model-independent: the whole point is that it works from any
 * session, including one running DeepSeek. Gating it on the provider would hide
 * the readout exactly when the feature is being used the way it was designed.
 * `cliBridge.enabled` needs no gate either — with the bridge off no turn can
 * begin, so the board is empty and the pill renders nothing.
 *
 * WHY POLLING, AND WHY THE INTERVAL IS 5s. The Host has no push channel to a
 * session component, so a poll is the only option. Five seconds is the slowest
 * cadence at which a turn that just started still feels immediate; the elapsed
 * counter between polls is advanced locally from `startedAt` (a 1s tick that
 * costs no request), so the number moves every second without the network
 * traffic moving with it. Concurrent sessions share ONE in-flight request per
 * interval (see {@link readLive}), which is what keeps N open tabs from becoming
 * N polls per tick.
 *
 * WHY THE CLOCK OFFSET IS APPLIED. `startedAt` is the HOST's clock. A browser
 * whose clock is a minute behind would compute a negative age and the pill would
 * print nonsense. The document ships `serverTime`, so the offset is measured at
 * each successful read and applied to the local clock instead of trusting the
 * two machines to agree.
