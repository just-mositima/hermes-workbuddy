/**
 * The card's OAuth QR sign-in section: one resting bar row plus a dialog
 * opened by the sign-in button.
 *
 * 参考：workbuddy2api-panel 的「添加账号」弹窗交互形态 —— 静态入口一行，
 *   点开后弹窗内分步走：获取授权链接 → 自动打开浏览器 → 弹窗内显示链接
 *   与等待状态 → 完成/失败回填结果。本实现沿用该步骤划分；弹窗样式直接
 *   用本项目导出/导入弹框的类（dsm-workbuddy-transfer-dialog），不引入
 *   第二套视觉。
 * 改动：自动打开浏览器。弹窗拦截的规避方式是「用户手势内同步 window.open
 *   占位，拿到授权 URL 后再导航」——点击「获取授权链接」的那一刻浏览器
 *   仍认定这是用户激活的手势链，占位窗口不会被拦；若 Host 环境连占位都
 *   拦（返回 null），降级为弹窗内手动「打开登录页」链接，功能不损失。
 *
 * 轮询循环压成一个组件内 effect：按 `OAUTH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` 节奏问 Host
 *   「完成了吗」，完成即停。所有状态就地管理，零跨组件往返；Host 重启
 *   导致 loginId 失效会得到 done+error，与超时同一条文案路径。

  /**
   * End the `syncing` phase — on the re-read, or on the deadline, whichever
   * comes first (issue #51).
   *
   * ## Why this is a separate effect and not an `await` in the poll
   *
   * The first attempt at this fix put the race inside the poll's `done` branch:
   *
   *     setPhase({ kind: 'syncing', accountName })
   *     await settlesWithin(onAdded?.(), SYNC_SETTLE_TIMEOUT_MS)
   *     if (cancelled || !mounted.current) return
   *     setPhase({ kind: 'finished', … })
   *
   * and it did not work — measured, not assumed. `phase` is a dependency of the
   * poll effect, so `setPhase({kind:'syncing'})` re-runs that effect, and React
   * runs the PREVIOUS cleanup first. That cleanup sets the old closure's
   * `cancelled = true`. React commits the cleanup before the `await` it is
   * inside ever resumes, so the resume always sees `cancelled === true` and
   * returns: the veil stayed up exactly as it had before.
   *
   * This also explains why the defect was invisible in review. A FAST re-read
   * resolves inside the same microtask batch, before React commits the cleanup,
   * so it passes the guard and the success line appears. Only a re-read slow
   * enough to cross a React commit — i.e. the reported case — loses the race
   * against its own cleanup. The bug hid behind its own common path.
   *
   * Running the wait in an effect keyed on the phase sidesteps the whole
   * interaction: this effect's own cleanup runs when the phase LEAVES
   * `syncing`, which is after it has already done its job, so there is no
   * self-cancellation to lose.
   *
   * ## The two outcomes
   *
   * Both end in `finished`/`added` and the difference is deliberately not shown
   * to the user. The account IS added — the Host stored the credential before it
   * answered the poll — so the honest report is success either way; the deadline
   * only stops the screen from claiming otherwise indefinitely. (`refreshUsage`
   * already surfaces a failed re-read as `refreshError` on the card itself, so
   * a genuinely broken usage route is still reported, by the component that
   * owns that data.)
