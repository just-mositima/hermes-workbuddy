/**
 * The upstream's promotion badges: how they are read, and WHEN they hold.
 *
 * The risk this file guards against is not the parsing — it is the CLOCK. A
 * promotion badge is a function of the clock: the upstream's campaigns run on
 * wall-clock hours in a named zone (`23:00`–`7:50` Asia/Shanghai is the
 * observed CN night discount), so a badge chosen when the document was read
 * would keep claiming the night after the night is over. Every assertion
 * below therefore asks "what holds NOW", not "what was parsed".
 *
 * The fixtures are the upstream's REAL entries, copied from the global feed's
 * `/v3/config` on 2026-10-21 — including the two entries in
 * `modelPromotions` that are not promotions at all (the image and video
 * models), because dropping those is a parsing rule, not an accident.
