/**
 * The upstream's promotion badge, rendered.
 *
 * The badge is the one thing in this card that says something the USER did
 * not configure: it is the upstream's own promotion, published in the same
 * document as the roster. Three properties are worth pinning, and all three
 * are about not overstating what the upstream said:
 *
 * 1. It says the upstream's own words — its label, its colour, its copy.
 * 2. It is GONE once the promotion is over. A badge that outlives its
 *    promotion is worse than no badge: the user would read "限时免费" as a
 *    standing fact about the model.
 * 3. It costs the row one chip, not a column: a model row is one line wide
 *    and already carries the name, the credit rate and two checkboxes.
