/**
 * Issues #87 / #88 / #89 / #90, second half: the gateway's CHANNEL gate is its
 * own failure, and the reply must name the line that tripped it.
 *
 * THE REPORT. Both gateways match the OPENING of every `system` message against
 * a list of known third-party-agent prompts and answer `400` + business code
 * `11128` on a hit. The upstream's own `displayTips` describes that as "this
 * call failed channel verification, possibly because it was not sent from an
 * official client" — which sent four separate reporters through account swaps,
 * region swaps and even a reinstall of the official client. None of it could
 * work: every account sends the same prompt.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG IN THE PLUGIN, and each item is a test below.
 *
 *   1. `11128` classified as `client` — the generic bucket. The reader got
 *      "refused on its parameters, another account will not help", which is true
 *      and useless: it does not say WHAT was refused, so the prompt was never a
 *      suspect.
 *   2. The body's `displayTips` was not even echoed — the misleading sentence
 *      was, because the generic path prefers it for `client` failures.
 *   3. `client` was not failover-worthy, so behaviour happened to be right — but
 *      only by accident of bucket membership, not because the code knew a
 *      second account cannot change a byte of the prompt.
 *   4. The probe classified the same refusal as `failed`, so the one card that
 *      could explain "test passes, chat fails" printed "✗ Test failed" instead.
 *
 * THE HARD PART IS NOT RECOGNISING THE GATE, IT IS NOT OVER-RECOGNISING IT.
 * Code `11128` is shared with at least two other gates — `conversation id
 * missing` (the header rule issue #66 fixed) and `first message is not system
 * prompt`. Both must keep their existing classification, because telling a user
 * to rewrite their system prompt when the real fault is a header would be a
 * confidently wrong diagnosis. The bodies below are byte-exact captures from the
 * live CN gateway and from the issue threads.

/**
 * The HOST's own view of the failure.
 *
 * WHY THIS BLOCK EXISTS. Everything above asserts on what the PLUGIN writes. But
 * the plugin's sentence only reaches the user if the host keeps it — and the
 * host does not always keep it: `failureMessage()` in
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-chat` hard-codes its own wording for `QUOTA` /
 * `ACCOUNT_QUOTA` and DISCARDS the plugin's message (that is the whole of issue
 * #84). The host also picks the failure CLASS by regexing English text out of
 * `type + " " + code + " " + message` (`classifyPiAiError()` in
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai`), and that class decides whether the request is
 * retried in place.
 *
 * So the decisive claim is not "the shim wrote a good message" but "the host
 * classifies this as a terminal 400 and shows the plugin's sentence". This block
 * drives the REAL pi-ai client — the same `stream()` the host uses — against
 * the REAL shim over a real socket, and then asks the host's OWN predicate.
 *
 * The risk this guards is specific and real: our message says 「不是账号、额度
 * 或网络问题」, and the upstream's `displayTips` says 「不是官方客户端发出的」.
 * Both are Chinese prose about limits, and a classifier that matched Chinese
 * quota wording would file this as an account limit and show the wrong remedy.
