/**
 * Issue #77 from the CARD's side: the account table must appear from the
 * first-paint document, before any full document lands.
 *
 * The route tests (`tests/issue77-fast-first-paint.spec.ts`) prove a fast
 * document makes no upstream call. That is necessary but not sufficient: the
 * reported symptom was the PANEL, so the fix only counts if the rows are on
 * screen from that document alone. These tests mount the real card with a stub
 * whose full-document answer NEVER resolves, and assert that the account table
 * is rendered anyway — the shape the reporter would have seen instantly.
