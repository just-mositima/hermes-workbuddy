/**
 * Issue #77: the account list must not wait for billing.
 *
 * THE REPORT. After updating the plugin, opening the settings page took 30–60
 * seconds before any account appeared — on a machine where 4.6.7 showed them
 * instantly. The screenshot taken ~30 s in shows the SIGNED-OUT branch ("detect
 * accounts / scan to add"), which is what an absent document used to render as.
 *
 * THE CAUSE. The card painted nothing until ONE document landed, and that
 * document's tail awaited an upstream call per account: `poolMembersOf` fetched
 * credits for every member, `checkedInToday` fetched check-in for every account,
 * and the selected account paid its own two requests. Each has a 30-second
 * timeout and no retry (`JSON_TIMEOUT_MS` in src/upstream.ts), so a slow or
 * throttled upstream stacked them.
 *
 * THE FIX under test here: `detail=fast` answers from LOCAL state only — the
 * credential already on disk, the local pool roster and the already-measured
 * check-in cells — so the account table costs one local round trip. The full
 * document still follows and upgrades the live figures.
 *
 * These tests count CALLS on the dependencies rather than inspecting prose: the
 * whole point is that a first paint makes no upstream request at all, and a
 * future edit that reintroduces one must fail here.
