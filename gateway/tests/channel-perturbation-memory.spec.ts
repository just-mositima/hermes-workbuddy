/**
 * Skipping the doomed first attempt once the gateway has proven it refuses the
 * plain body (measured 2026-10-22).
 *
 * THE DEFECT. The retry ladder is discover-by-failing: send the plain body, get
 * `11128`, re-send a perturbed copy. Correct the first time, wasteful every time
 * after — the prompt SHAPE does not change between turns, so the plugin paid a
 * refused request (~209ms measured) on EVERY request.
 *
 * WHAT MUST HOLD. After one perturbation succeeds, the next request starts
 * perturbed; and if a perturbed body is ever refused, the preference is cleared
 * so the plugin rediscovers what works instead of being stuck.
 *
 * The flag is process-local on purpose: the gateway's fingerprint list can be
 * withdrawn as easily as extended, and a persisted flag would outlive the
 * condition that justified it.
